# 3D Gaussian Splatting Colab Template

Hello! This template is for people who want to play around with 3d gaussian splatting with their own dataset but do not have suitable hardware.
<br />
You can run this template in Google Colab and train your own dataset.
<br />

1. Make sure you select a GPU that supports CUDA. <br />
  1.1. I recommend V100, as I find it the most cost-efficient.
2. Upload your dataset to Google Drive and mount it in Colab. <br />
3. Replace the path: {path_to_dataset} <br />
4. Follow the instructions in the template.
